# Artistic-Image-Generation-Using-GANs

***

## Dataset is standard [wikiart dataset](https://www.wikiart.org/)

## Model
  It is Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network with some concept of WGAN and DCGAN.

## How To Run
   There are Two ways to run the Repo : Local Computer OR Google Colab platform
    
    1. Image resize
    2. RBGA -> RGB 
    3. Artistic GAN (tensorboard command are like tf.summary and see doc for tf board to run https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard)
